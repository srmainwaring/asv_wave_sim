# Ignition Marine

This package contains plugins that support the simulation of waves and surface vessels in Ignition Gazebo.

## Notes

The branch `ign-marine` represents a major reworking of the original wave simulation code developed for Gazebo9 and Gazebo11.

A number of features available in the original version, such as updating parameters via messages, have not been migrated to Ignition. On the other hand there are new features from the `feature/fft_waves` development branch that have been included, such as Ocean tiling and different wave generation methods.

There are changes in the way that the wave parameters need to be set, and it may not be possible to avoid breaking the existing interface used to specify trochoidal waves. This is still work in progress, and the current version has a fixed set of wave parameters.

The library has additional dependencies on two FFT libraries:

- [clMathLibraries/clFFT](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT)
- [fftw](http://www.fftw.org/)

These can be installed on linux with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install fftw clfft
```

And on macOS with:

```bash
brew fftw3 libclfft-dev libfftw3-dev
```

Aside from adding the option to use a FFT generated wavefield, the major change is in the way that the visuals are generated. Previously the wave displacements for visuals were generated in the shader code, the visual plugin was used to update shader parameters for wave amplitudes and frequency. Now the entire mesh for the visual is dynamically updated in the the library then pushed into the rendering engine. This means there is no need to maintain various sized meshes in the media files, however it does require working around Gazebos requirement for static meshes and there is a custom Visual that implements this. The OpenCL FFT library allows this work to be offloaded to the GPU when configured.

## Dependencies

You will need a working installation of Ignition Garden in order to use this package. This will require a from source build, see the [Ignition Garden documents](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/garden) for details.

The dependency on ROS has been removed.

## Ubuntu (pending tests)

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ignition Garden

Install CGAL:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
```

### macOS

- OSX 11.6.2
- Ignition Garden

Install CGAL (5.3.1):

```bash
brew install cgal
```

## Installation

We suppose the Ignition source has been cloned to a developer workspace `~/ign_ws/src`.

### Build Ignition

On macOS you can build with the `RPATH` settings disabled. This allows you to run Gazebo from the install directory without having to disable SIP. From `~/ign_ws` run:

```bash
colcon build --merge-install --cmake-args \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
-DCMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH=FALSE \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR=$(pwd)/install/lib
```

Then source the installation:

```bash
source ./install/setup.zsh
```

### Clone and build the package

Clone the `asv_wave_sim` repository:

```bash
cd ~/ign_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/srmainwaring/asv_wave_sim.git -b feature/ign-garden-wip
```

Compile the package:

```bash
colcon build --merge-install --cmake-args \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
-DCMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH=FALSE \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR=$(pwd)/install/lib \
--packages-select ignition-marine1
```

Then re-source the workspace:

```bash
source ./install/setup.zsh
```

## Usage

### Set environment variables

```bash
# for future use - to support multiple ignition versions
export IGNITION_VERSION=garden

# not usually required as should default to localhost address
export IGN_IP=127.0.0.1

# ensure ignition finds the config for this installation
export IGN_CONFIG_PATH=\
$HOME/ign_ws/install/share/ignition

# ensure the model and world files are found
export IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=\
$HOME/ign_ws/src/asv_wave_sim/ign-marine-models/models:\
$HOME/ign_ws/src/asv_wave_sim/ign-marine-models/world_models:\
$HOME/ign_ws/src/asv_wave_sim/ign-marine-models/worlds
```

## Examples

Launch an Ignition Gazebo session.

Server:

```bash
ign gazebo -v4 -s -r waves.sdf
```

Client:

```bash
ign gazebo -v4 -g
```

The session should include a wave field and the floating objects depicted in the image at head of this document.

## Changes

There are some changes to the plugin SDF schema for hydrodynamics and waves.   

### Waves model and visual plugins

- The `filename` and `name` attributes for the wave model and visal plugins have changed.
- The `<size>` element has been renamed to `<tile_size>` and moved into `<waves>`
- The `<cell_count>` element has been moved into `<waves>`
- Add new element `<algorithm>` to specify the wave generation algorithm. Valid options are: `sinusoid`, `trochoid` and `fft`.
- Add new element `<wind_velocity>` for use with the `fft` algorithm.
- Add new element `<wind_speed>` for use with the `fft` algorithm.
- Add new element `<wind_angle_deg>` for use with the `fft` algorithm.

```xml
<plugin
    filename="ignition-marine1-waves-model-system"
    name="ignition::gazebo::systems::WavesModel">
    <static>0</static>
    <update_rate>30</update_rate>
    <wave>
      <!-- Algorithm: sinusoid, trochoid, fft  -->
      <algorithm>fft</algorithm>

      <!-- Cell count must be a power of 2 for fft waves -->
      <tile_size>256</tile_size>
      <cell_count>128</cell_count>
      
      <!-- `fft` waves parameters -->
      <wind_speed>5.0</wind_speed>
      <wind_angle_deg>45</wind_angle_deg>
      <steepness>1</steepness>

      <!-- `trochoid` waves parameters -->
      <number>3</number>
      <scale>1.5</scale>
      <angle>0.4</angle>
      <amplitude>0.4</amplitude>
      <period>8.0</period>
      <phase>0.0</phase>
      <steepness>1.0</steepness>
      <direction>1 0</direction>
    </wave>
</plugin>
```

### Hydrodynamics plugin

- The `filename` and `name` attributes for the hydrodynamics plugin have changed.
- The hydrodynamics parameters are now scoped in an additional `<hydrodynamics>` element.
- The `<wave_model>` element is not currently used.
- The `<markers>` element is not currently used (not implemented).

```xml
<plugin
  filename="ignition-marine1-hydrodynamics-system"
  name="ignition::gazebo::systems::Hydrodynamics">

   <!-- Hydrodynamics -->
   <hydrodynamics>
    <damping_on>1</damping_on>
    <viscous_drag_on>1</viscous_drag_on>
    <pressure_drag_on>1</pressure_drag_on>

    <!-- Linear and Angular Damping -->  
    <cDampL1>1.0E-6</cDampL1>
    <cDampL2>1.0E-6</cDampL2>
    <cDampR1>1.0E-6</cDampR1>
    <cDampR2>1.0E-6</cDampR2>

    <!-- 'Pressure' Drag -->
    <cPDrag1>1.0E+2</cPDrag1>
    <cPDrag2>1.0E+2</cPDrag2>
    <fPDrag>0.4</fPDrag>
    <cSDrag1>1.0E+2</cSDrag1>
    <cSDrag2>1.0E+2</cSDrag2>
    <fSDrag>0.4</fSDrag>
    <vRDrag>1.0</vRDrag>
  </hydrodynamics>
</plugin>
```
